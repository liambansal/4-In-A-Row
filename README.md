# ----- Instructions -----

1. It isn't recommended to play the game with an active VPN connection or any background VPN processes because
they have been known to disable certain online features. Therefore I would recommend closing any VPN and shutting
down any of its background processes before playing.

2. It's usually best to restart the game if an error is logged in the console (which automatically appears if there's an error),
to ensure all features are working as intended when playing.
