# ---------- Known Issues ----------

1. Playing the game with an active VPN connection or any background VPN processes running will interfere with and 
most likely disable the game's online features. Therefore it's recommended to close any VPN as well as its background 
processes before opening the game.

2. It's usually best to restart the application when an error is logged in the console window to ensure all of the 
game's features work as intended. Some of these errors are:
- Error: 'Received a packet with an invalid pipeline'.
- Error: 'Resetting event queue with pending events'.
Other errors are produced by:
- Entering an incorrect password when joining a lobby.
Unfortunately, a fix for these issues isn't known at the time of this update's release.
