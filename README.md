# ----- Hello World -----

Hello, thank you for taking the time to download my game. I hope you enjoy playing!

# ----- Instructions -----

1. Playing the game with an active VPN connection or any background VPN processes running will interfere with, and 
most likely disable the game's online features. For example, NordVPN is known to do this.
Therefore I would recommend closing any VPN and shutting down any of its background processes before playing.

2. If an error is logged in the console, which appears automatically if there's an error, it's usually best to restart 
the application to ensure all of the game's features work as intended. Sorry about this :(

# ----- Download -----

1. Visit my portfolio at: https://www.liambansal.com to download new versions of the game and stay up to date with new content.
Only the most recent version of the game will be fully supported with online gameplay.
