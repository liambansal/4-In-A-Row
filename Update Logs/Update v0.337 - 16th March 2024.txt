Match Objectives & Statistics and More Feedback for Actions
16th March 2024 - v0.337

---------- Description ----------
Hello again, this update introduces lots of new content like match objectives, a game-over screen, visual effects when 
scoring points, a loading screen, sounds for squashing counters, animations, info about each counter and tile, and 
makes some changes to balance and improve content. Oh, and there are more fixes too, hooray!


---------- Additions ----------
Gameplay
- Added objectives for ending a match whether it's reaching a score threshold or playing for a certain number of turns.
- Created new spawn animations for the grid of tiles and the side-panel when opening the gameplay scene.

Audio
- A new sound effect will play whenever a counter is squashed.

UI
- Created a game-over menu that shows match statistics, which appears upon finishing a game. Statistics include:
	- The time spent playing by each player.
	- The longest scoring line that was created by each player.
	- The most points each player scored in a single turn.
	- And more!
	- The best match statistics are highlighted.
- Counters that reward players with points will play a new visual effect.
- Counters that block an opponent's potential scoring line will play a new visual effect.
- Displayed the match's score & maximum turn objectives in the side-panel.
- Hovering over a tile or counter with the cursor will now reveal information about its coordinates, owner, type, and 
more.
- Added a simple loading screen between changing scenes.


---------- Changes ----------
Gameplay
- Players will now remain in their current lobby after leaving an online match when it ends, so it's easier to continue
playing with the other player.
- Power-ups no longer spawn on the same player's turn more than once in a row.
- Tethered counters that are pulled out of their tile will now move towards their connected counters that are 
already moving rather than always towards a counter that's being flung.
- Prevented floating block counters from being moved when using the fling power-up on them (unless the gravity
strength is high enough) or flinging a counter that's tethered to them.
- Collected power-ups are now removed from players when mutators are regenerated.
- Power-up counters will no longer respawn when mutators are regenerated.
- Turns will only end after all counters have stopped moving instead of as soon as a counter is placed.

UI
- The lobby screen is now automatically reopened when returning to the main menu from an online match if the player 
is still connected to the lobby.
- Hidden the side-panel's restart button when playing in an online match.
- A mutator's help box now appears when also hovering over its name.
- The power-up icons no longer appear in the side-panel if the relevant mutator is disabled.
- The power-up selection wheel's buttons will now be un-interactable if the relevant power-up hasn't been collected by 
the player.
- Changed the background colours for the power-up selection wheel so it fits in better with the game's colour scheme.
- The turn counter now starts on 1 instead of 0.
- Improved scaling for UI elements that are part of a list when the screen size changes.
- Improved scaling for scroll bars when the screen size changes.
- Changed the background colour of all scroll bars to be near black instead of white.


---------- Fixes ----------
Gameplay Fixes
- Fixed falling counters not scoring any points for blocking an opponent's potential scoring lines.
- Fixed single tethered counters potentially never locking into a tile when dangling in mid-air from their connection.
- Fixed tethered counters not locking into a tile when they're suspended from their connections and have no other 
adjacent counters.
- Fixed tethered counters not being assigned to a tile after being flung and landing on top of other counters.
- Fixed counters that are moved with the fling power-up travelling in a straight line and leaving the grid if gravity 
is disabled.
- Fixed non-host clients not being able to return to the main menu.
- Fixed instances of the fling power-up counter interfering with the flinging counters.
- Fixed vertically aligned tethered counters thinking they're offset to the right from their connection.

Networking Fixes
- Network-objects spawned at runtime are now despawned when the host client disconnects from a lobby, loads a scene,
or unloads a scene. This prevents non-host clients from triggering errors when trying to destroy those objects.
- Fixed the 'network objects not cleaned up' error when the host client closes the gameplay scene.
- Fixed clients not being disconnected properly when all other clients unexpectedly close their game e.g. pressing 
Alt+F4.
- Fixed a client's network ID being set to zero when the real ID cannot be obtained as they disconnect.
- Fixed a case where joining clients wouldn't react to the host leaving the lobby.
- Fixed joining clients not registering when they've finished loading a scene.
- Fixed the host client disappearing from their own lobby when another player leaves it.
- Fixed joining clients not disappearing on the host's lobby screen when they leave.
- Fixed multiple lobbies being able to use the same name if they're both created around the same time.
- Fixing the empty lobby details not being hidden when the client leaves a lobby after returning to the main menu from 
a match.

UI Fixes
- Fixed the timeline showing the wrong order of turns after restarting a match.
- Fixed consecutive turns for a single player appearing in the timeline when turns are taken in quick succession.
- Fixed the timeline events permanently showing their placeholder icons.
- Fixed the joining client's tiles not highlighting when they select a power-up.
- Fixed the mutator list's scroll bar always moving the list to a position where it wasn't fully visible.
- The side-panel's text element that shows the current turn is now reset after restarting a match.
- Fixed the cursor being reverted to its default image while in an online match and after finishing it.
- Fixed the option menu's SFX slider being very small and not centred.
- Fixed several side-panel background counters' blur effects covering the tile grid.

Other  Fixes
- Fixed some code being executed multiple times when it was only needed once.
- Many null reference fixes.

Additionally, much work has been done to support the new content behind the scenes and lots of code has been 
refactored so it's easier to maintain and expand certain aspects of the game going forward.

Thanks for playing,
