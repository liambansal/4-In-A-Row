Customisable Match Settings and Improved Overall Stability
7th October 2024 - v0.362

~~~~~~~~~~ Description ~~~~~~~~~~
Hi there, this update introduces a set of new options for customising the match settings before starting a match and
many important fixes. The settings feature things like the score to win, grid size, all of the mutator options, and a 
few presets for quickly selecting specific game types. Hope you enjoy!


~~~~~~~~~~ Additions ~~~~~~~~~~
- Created a menu for customizing the match settings before starting a local or online game.
- Created a menu for changing the game settings from the main menu.
- A prompt for confirming/cancelling important actions such as leaving a match or closing the game will now appear on-
screen.
- Added a new fullscreen window mode option in the game's settings menu.
- Added a new option for toggling the confirm action prompt on/off in the game's settings menu.


~~~~~~~~~~ Changes ~~~~~~~~~~
- The mutator settings can now be changed from the main menu before starting a match.
- Mutator settings can no longer be changed once a match has started.
- Changed all text elements' fonts that display a lobby name or password so different character cases are noticeable.
- The cursor helper icon now returns to the selected power-up after the ? icon disappears from hovering over a 
mutator's help icon.
- Improved the descriptions for all of the mutators.
- The collected power-ups' background now shrinks when no power-ups are enabled.
- Limited how many times the 'player ready' RPC can be sent to clients per second to prevent players from sending 
unnecessary data.
- Changed the default window mode to exclusive fullscreen.
- Made more use of the available space in the main menu to make the menus larger.
- UI elements in the main menu scene now scale better when the screen size changes.
- Changed the floating blocks spawn animation to a fade-in effect.
- Slightly improved the appearance of the lobby screen's backgrounds.
- Changed the colour of several UI elements when they're not interactable.


~~~~~~~~~~ Fixes ~~~~~~~~~~
- Addressed the 'resetting event queue' error triggering when a player attempts to join a lobby by showing an error 
message and then closing the application, so it's clear the game cannot be played if this error is ever triggered.
- Reduced the chances of the 'received packet with invalid pipeline' error from occurring.
- Fixed clients not disconnecting from their lobby when another client leaves while loading the gameplay scene.
- Fixed the loading screen staying open indefinitely when another player disconnects before they start loading the 
gameplay scene.
- Fixed the '404 Not Found' error appearing when a player attempts to join a lobby that has closed but is still 
visible in the lobby browser.
- Fixed the query lobbies rate limit being reached.
- Fixed several bugs relating to tethered counters not falling when they're supposed to.
- Fixed mutator sound effects not playing after loading into a match for the second time.
- Fixed counters getting pulled out of their tile when one of their tethered counters falls to gravity.
- Fixed multiple counters being assigned to a single tile and overwriting each other.
- Fixed counters not always appearing exactly on top of their tile. The host client and joining client must use the 
same aspect ratio for their application to avoid this error.
- Fixed several UI elements potentially appearing/stretching off-screen.
- Fixed a network error triggering whenever a player attempted to join a lobby using the wrong password.
- Fixed the host client being unable to return to the main menu through the game over menu after the joining 
client has left the match.
- An online match will now be cancelled as soon as the gameplay scene is loaded if a client disconnected during the 
load process.
- Fixed players getting too many points for their score streak when scoring multiple lines in a single turn.
- Fixed blocked lines being highlighted and spawning point VFX when created at the same time as a scoring line.
- Fixed the power-up icons not enabling when a match starts.
- Fixed clients registering multiple callbacks to certain network events when creating a lobby, joining a lobby, or 
leaving a lobby.
- Fixed clients having to ready up multiple times before the connected clients received their ready state after the 
first match.
- Players no longer need to reselect a power-up to see which tiles it can interact with after an opponent places a 
counter.
- Players no longer need to reselect a power-up to see which tiles it can interact with after a counter has moved.
- Fixed floating block counters not respawning when regenerating the mutators in a local match.
- Fixed the '_MainTex property missing' error appearing because of the blur shader.
- Fixed the scoreboard appearing in a new match when a match is restarted before the scoreboard appears on-screen.
- Players can now see the lobby password after they've joined a lobby.
- Fixed the power-up selection wheel's buttons staying enabled when the mutators are reset in a local match.
- Fixed the cursor helper icon still showing the previously selected power-up when restarting a local match.
- Fixed the cursor's helper icon disappearing when clicking on a tile without using the power-up in an online match.
- Fixed the selected tile outline showing even when it's disabled in the settings.
- Fixed the scoreboard playing the wrong animation and hiding as soon as it appears on screen.
- Fixed the scoreboard only playing its spawn/reveal animation once across multiple matches.
- Fixed the game still being paused after closing the pause menu through using its close button.
- Fixed the trail emitter being turned on for the joining client's stationary power-ups.
- Fixed the scoreboard's show/hide button only being highlighted once when hovering over it.
- Fixed being able to scroll past the last element in the scoreboard.


Until next time,
